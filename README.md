# Svelte + Tailwind Template

_Looking for the official Svelte template? Go here --> [github.com/sveltejs/template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template)_

This web application template was put together with [Svelte 3](https://svelte.dev) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). 

## Setup

```bash
[~] npx degit tobius/svelte-template app && cd app
[~/app] npm i
```

## Development

```bash
[~/app] npm run dev
```

- Open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- Edit a component file in `src`
- Save it (the browser will reload automatically)

## Production

Every environment is different, but the same basic steps exist for all:

1. Point your preinstall command at `npm run build`
2. Point your start command at `npm run start`
